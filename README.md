#Projeto de machine learning feito usando TensorFlow ML 

### The Project includes two main notebooks: "Getting Started.ipynb" and "image collection automation.ipynb"

#### Automates satellite image capture from Google Earth within a specified area defined by start/end coordinates. 
#### It opens the browser, enters each coordinate pair, takes screenshots, crops to the region of interest, and converts PNGs to JPGs. 
#### Uses the pyautogui, pyperclip, and Pillow libraries. 

#### "Getting Started.ipynb": 
#### Builds a TensorFlow convolutional neural network to classify images. It installs dependencies, removes invalid images,
#### loads and normalizes the data, splits into training/validation/test sets, trains the model, plots loss and accuracy, and reports precision metrics.
