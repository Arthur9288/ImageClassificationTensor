# Machine Learning Project with TensorFlow

## Notebooks

### 1. Getting Started.ipynb  
Builds a TensorFlow convolutional neural network to classify images.  
- Installs dependencies  
- Removes invalid images  
- Loads and normalizes data  
- Splits into training/validation/test sets  
- Trains the model  
- Plots loss and accuracy  
- Reports precision metrics  

### 2. Image Collection Automation.ipynb  
Automates satellite image capture from Google Earth within a specified area defined by start/end coordinates.  
- Opens the browser and navigates to Google Earth  
- Enters each coordinate pair and searches  
- Takes screenshots and crops to the region of interest  
- Converts PNGs to JPGs  
- Uses the **pyautogui**, **pyperclip**, and **Pillow** libraries
